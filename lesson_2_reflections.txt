What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository I'm informing Git that I wish to track a set of files contained in the repository. I need to do it to initiate version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the repository because it provides for a transitory state for files to be tracked. It allows me to subset version control into logical steps and groupings
